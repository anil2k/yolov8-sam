# Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation with YOLOv8 and SAM



## Project Description

In this project, we leverage the power of YOLOv8 for object detection and a Segment Anything Model (SAM) for semantic segmentation. This combination allows us to detect objects in images and then perform pixel-wise segmentation to understand the context of these objects.
